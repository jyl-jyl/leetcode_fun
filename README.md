This is a project to use AI (including all types of models and tools) to make the learning of leetcode problems FUN and ACTUALLY USEFUL!!

Here are a couple of things I'd like to experiment based on one finding: algorithm is somewhat more or less about the Greedy Algorithm (need to be verified)
1. Start with a really really really simple algorithm
2. Ask AI what are some interesting points you known when digging a little deeper into that algorithm
3. I expect it's going to say something about THAT_ALGO + Greedy/DP
4. Learn all the way down to the CORE of algorithms

Just like an old saying goes： 先把书读厚，再把书读薄。（For non-Chinese speakers, this translates into “First read the book thick, then read the book thin.” I know it doesn't make any sense, sorry)
I belive the latter part would be a lot more fun if we can get through the hard bitter shell of the former part. This repository is a space for the fun stuff.
